"""Pydantic models and validation for audit run state.

The models in this file are the enforcement point for a hardening rule that
runs through the whole project: a rule that was never evaluated must not be
representable as a rule that passed. A :class:`DomainResult` cannot claim
``status="completed"`` while leaving a rule un-verdicted; :func:`validate_completeness`
is the loud check that catches it, listing exactly which rule ids are missing
rather than letting the gap pass unnoticed.
